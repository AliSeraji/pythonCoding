Simple way to write persian on image in python.

The data is read from a json file to be written on the image.

A few libraries are used in order to write Persian text properly on images.

Below are the resons why we have to use these libraries:

  1-We need to install BiDirectional library beacuse we need Persian letters to be written from right to left.
  
  2-We need Better-Arabic-Reshaper library because we need Persian letters to be connected to each other.
  
  3-We are good to go.
